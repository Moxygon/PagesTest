These are the conditions currently known:

- You need to die 20 or more times in gulps arena.
- You need to spend a total of 126000 frames (35 minutes) in gulps arena
- You must not previusly have beaten gulp doing the game file.

Back in match 2019 i came across a previusly uknown concept in the Gulp fight. Doing a practice session I suddenly realised that Gulp was taking 2 damage every time I hit him.
I then spend a couple of days trying to uncover what had happened.
