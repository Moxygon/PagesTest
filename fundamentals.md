I mainly use BizHawk when I dive in to the inner workings of the game, due to its builtin TASing features, easy accessable memory management and Lua scripting support.

The NTSC version of Spyro 2 runs at 60 fps, but the actual visual frame is only updated every other frame which means that is visually runs at 30 fps. Since most RAM values are related to what's shown on screen it's common that they also only update on every other frame, but some address will update on every frame.
