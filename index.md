## So... what's this?

I'm a Spyro 2 speedrunner and occasionally I like doing research on the game and test stuff. I wanted a place where i could show my result, so this site is dedicated to that.

I also wanted a public and easy accessible place for all the knowledge we currently have about this game.

I'll try to cover a variety of topics like: In-depth explanations of tricks, glitches and exploits, route comparisons, TASing and Lua scripting, and research in general.

Hopefully this will be useful to new runners as well as more experienced players.
